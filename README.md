# GodotPong

Simple Pong Clone I made using C# and the Godot Game engine as a learning tool for C#.
Contains several game modes and features:

- Player vs CPU & Player vs Player
- Fat Paddle Mode
- Faster Ball Speed Mode
- CPU Hard Mode

Next change will be to bounce physics on paddles so the angle changes depending on where on the paddle the ball hit.
